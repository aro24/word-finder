There once was pirate named Gold Roger, 
who was the King of the Pirates. 
He had fame, power and wealth 
beyond your wildest dreams. 
Before they hung him from the gallows, 
these were the last words he said. 
"My fortune's is yours for the taking, but you'll have to find it first. 
I left everything I own in One Piece. 
Ever since, pirates from around set out in search of One Piece, 
the tresure that will make their dreams come true.
